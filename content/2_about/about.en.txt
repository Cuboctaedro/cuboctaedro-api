    I am Dimitris Kottas, graphic and web designer, editor and publisher of books and PhD student in architecture and urban design. I have studied architecture and have worked many years at the publishing industry designing and editing books on architecture and design.

    I work mostly for artists, designers, architects and cultural institutions like museums and galleries but I welcome any creative challenge. I enjoy projects that combine design and editorial work.
