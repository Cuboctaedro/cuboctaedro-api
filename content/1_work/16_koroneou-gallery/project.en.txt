This is a website for an art gallery in Athens. The gallery exists for 25 years so the website has a big archive of exhibition documentation and many artist portfolios and CV's. The gallery used to have a website created using Flash which was good for its time but not functional with today's standards and devices. The back-end was complicated to use and it was desired to implement a better solution that would allow for easier management of the website.

The new website is responsive and is made using the Kirby CMS which offers a very friendly back-end environment for introducing new material to the site. The design is based on the earlier version of the website with a few changes  to improve navigation and functionality.
