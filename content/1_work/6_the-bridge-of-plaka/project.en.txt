Text: 

The bridge of Plaka is a traditional stone bridge in north-west Greece. recently it collapsed during a heavy rainfall and flood. Soon afterwards the Technical University of Athens initiated an extensive program of reconstruction. The book presents all the studies that were undertaken before the actual rebuilding. 

This is a very extensive work including everything from the history of the bridge and its importance to the local community to detail studies of its materials and structure. The result is a highly technical and content-heavy book with lots of plans, graphs data tables etc.
