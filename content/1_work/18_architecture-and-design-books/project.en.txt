Text: For almost ten years I worked as book designer and editor for LinksBooks, a publisher specialized in Architecture and Design. As an in-house designer and editor I worked on all parts of book development from initial idea, to research and editing, to design and creation of print files. This is a small selection of images from some of these books.
