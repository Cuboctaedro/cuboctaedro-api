The exhibition "The forest under the Road" at the Natural History Museum of the Lesvos Petrified Forest presents petrified trees and plants that were found during the construction of a new road on the island of Lesvos. The number of findings is huge and they still have not been completely excavated and cataloged, so the exhibition focuses not only on what has been found but also on the process of excavation and conservation and the work that will be done.

My work was to design the panels of the exhibition and the advertising banners. There were 20 panels in subject groups of three or four. According to the exhibition design the panels were to be hanged at different heights. This was used as a starting point for the design together with the idea of the *road* as a unifying element running through all the panels in the exhibition creating a horizontal axis. Greek texts were placed over the *road* and English texts under it.
