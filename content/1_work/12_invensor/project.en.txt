Invensor is a company that creates adsorption coolers. This a little-known technology with a broad field of applications. Therefore their website is very content-heavy with product presentations, technological explanations and case studies.

The website was designed in collaboration with [Melgrafik](http://melgrafik.de/). It was made using WordPress since the people at Invensor were more familiar with it and they wanted to be able to manage the website by themselves.
