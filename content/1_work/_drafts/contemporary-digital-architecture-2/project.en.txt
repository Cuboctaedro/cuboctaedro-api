Text: 

This is the second volume of the series Contemporary Digital Architecture. As with the first volume, the focus is on experimental projects by young designers. More importance has been given on parametric design and construction technologies than in the first volume. However, spanning 500 pages, the book offers an extensive overview of the entire field containing both technical and visionary projects. 

For this book I worked both as designer and editor starting the project from its initial conception and bringing it to the completion of the final layouts. I selected the projects to be published, contacted the designers and edited the final texts.
