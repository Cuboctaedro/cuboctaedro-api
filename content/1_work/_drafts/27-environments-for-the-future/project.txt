(columns…)

This book presents 44 innovative large-scale projects of urban architecture. All of the projects are new, none had been built at the time the book was created and quite a few are visionary projects that will not be implemented. For this book I have created and implemented the layouts. The selection of projects and editing of the content was done by the publisher.

++++

The book includes projects from some well-known architects like Daniel Liebeskind, Zaha Hadid, NOX, MVRDV and Emergent. The strong visual character of the book has dictated a layout that would promote the esthetics of the projects without overshadowing them. The book is 22 x 22 cm and has 300 pages.
