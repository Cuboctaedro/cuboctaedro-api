Eccentric Books publishes science fiction, fantasy, horror and related genres. It focuses on older texts that are now difficult to find in book form. The books are hardcover and great emphasis is placed on the quality of design and typography. The website functions as an online shop for the books and a blog, while also containing all other necessary supplementary elements (contact forms etc).

The site was made using Kirby and not a specialized online shop CMS. The design of the site is simple following a content-first approach. Emphasis has been placed on typography using typefaces closely related to the 19th century where most of the publisher's material originates.
