This is a small desk calendar of loose leafs packaged in a CD box. it was printed digitally on a limited edition. It was mostly given as a Christmas gift to friends and clients and some copies were sold to cover production expenses.

Each month has a different design and uses a different typeface. The typefaces are all quite recent releases mostly from small foundries and many of them are distributed for free. The back side of each card-month contains information about the typeface. The calendar is in German; it includes German holidays, week numbers and moon phases.
