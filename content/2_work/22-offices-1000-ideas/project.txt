This is a book on office building design. It presents design principles and many examples. The first part presents the theoretical principles of designing office spaces. The second, and larger part consists of various practical examples organized in chapters such as "Exteriors", "Working Space", "Furniture", etc.

The examples are drawn from the archive of the publisher who has published more than 10 books with office design projects.
My work was to select the examples from the archive, organize them in chapters, write the texts and develop the final layout. Each spread presents one or two project examples.
