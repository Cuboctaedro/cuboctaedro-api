This is a website for the artist and jewelry-maker Klaus Raszynski. Klaus creates unique handcrafted jewelry from organic materials and recycled skateboard decks. The site is a portfolio and an e-shop for selling his work. For this project I have created the design and developed the website and I have also photographed the objects.

The site is made using the Kirby CMS and is responsive, using three different layouts for desktop or laptop, tablet and phone.
