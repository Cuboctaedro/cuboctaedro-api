The Scientific Romances book series presents obscure and forgotten works of early science fiction from the 19th century. The books are hardcover royal octavo size (234 x 156 mm). The objective, as with all Eccentric Books publications, is to create a design that maintains references to the typography of the period without becoming retro.

The first book published is *The Goddess of Atvatabar*, a fairly unknown novel of the "hollow earth" sub-genre. The book was richly illustrated in its original edition and all of the images have been used in the new edition. The book covers refer stylistically to 19th century posters using a loud advertising tone that plays ironically with the relative obscurity of the work, a theme that will be used for all the books in the series.
