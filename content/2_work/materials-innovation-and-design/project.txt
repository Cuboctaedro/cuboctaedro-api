(columns…)

This book presents a wide selection of new and innovative construction materials. The materials and components presented have been selected for their technical or visual innovative characteristics. Most of them are materials available on the marketplace but there are also a few things that are still in development and will not reach the market for a few years. The book does not offer an academic or highly technical treatment of the subject; instead it is addressed at the average designer as an information source about the latest tendencies in construction materials. 

++++

The book has 240 pages and is 242 x 284 mm. Each material is presented on a single or double page with explanatory text, images and contact details of the firm. I have worked both as editor and designer doing the initial research, contacting the various firms organizing the materials in chapters and designing the final layout.
