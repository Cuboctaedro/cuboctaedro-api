(columns…)

This is a thematic wall calendar for 2010. It includes holidays for many countries, astronomical events and many science- and SF-related anniversaries (birthdays of authors and scientists, scientific events, first screenings of important movies, etc). It is printed on 50 copies on 250gr paper.

++++

The illustrations for each month relate to one of the anniversaries. Some are more obvious (like the first appearance of the *Space Invaders* video game), while others are more cryptic and its up to the user to relate them with the events mentioned each month.
