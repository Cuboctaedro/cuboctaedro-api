The *New Graphic Design* book series presents a selection of the best recent graphic design projects organized thematically. Two books have already been published, *Corporate and Institutional Graphics *and *Art and Creativity Graphics*. A third book, *Music and Entertainment Graphics* is ready and will be published soon and more books will follow. Each book contains about 100 projects from various designers. The scale and format of the projects varies greatly, from a single business card to a full-scale corporate identity.

For this series I have worked up to now as both editor and designer. As editor I made the initial selection of projects, contacted the designers, compiled and organized the material and provided texts when needed. As designer i created the master layout and implemented it on the first three books. The layout is simple and straightforward, using a grid for the images and a simple but distinctive header so as to bring the content to the foreground.
